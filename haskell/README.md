# Advent of Code - Haskell

These are [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solvers written in Haskell. Most of the solvers will be from 2025, but I might wander into other years in my attempt to learn.

## Why Haskell?

It was first suggested to me in 2016 as one way to practice understanding the principles of functional programming. Despite the delightfully named and written [Learn You a Haskell For Great Good](https://learnyouahaskell.github.io/) I was far too intimidated by the language and rejected the advice. Nearly 10 years and many more programming hours later, I decided to give it a try.

## Running the solvers
All of the solutions are run using the Haskell repl [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) at the command line.

Once it is installed, you can load in a file and run the `main` function.

```
ghci> l: fileName.txt
ghci> main
```
